# Advent of Code 2020
Advent of Code 2020 is imminent! Prepare ye the way!

## Goals

* [✔]To stream, as early as January 2020.
* To familiarize myself with .NET 5.
* [✔🟡🟡🟡🟡]During this special time of Advent, in which we celebrate the coming of Advent of Code 2020, in the spirit of reverence and fastidious self-contemplation, solve as many as five (5) Advent of Code 2018 challenges.
    * [✔]Clarifying rule: I may choose any of the 2018 problems, and I may choose to solve one or both stars. It's not my fault if I declare vendetta against some of the more frustrating "fun puzzles".
    * [✔🟡🟡🟡🟡]Do something different!
    * [✔✔✔✔✔]Code golf is garbage (❌⛳❌). Let's not do code golf.
